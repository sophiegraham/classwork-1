# Class 03 Node Architecture and Asynchronous Programming

## Questions and Feedback

* gitignore global
* eslint
* ?

## Learning Objectives

* Have a working model of asynchronous programming in NodeJS
* Write and utilize asynchronous callback functions effectively:
    * When calling node asynchronous APIs
    * When exposing a function
* Utilize the filesystem
* Use a class to hold onto state

## Agenda

### Node.JS Architecture

* What is it?
* Node Event Loop
    * Basic node architecture 101
    * v8 + event-loop + os-lib
    * Thread - actual "thread of execution"
    * Event loop explained
    * JavaScript single threaded event model
* Demo: `event-loop.js`

### Passing functions in javascript

* How do we
    * return values?
    * Propagate errors?
* JavaScript Async Callback Styles
    * "Old School" Node callback pattern: `callback(err, result)`
    * Promises FTW!
    * ~~Promise FTW!s~~ `async`/`await` FTW!
* Some hard rules:
    1. You can't create asynchronicity with just js
    1. If your building functionality on top of asynchronous APIs, then your library must be asynchronous!
    1. If a function or method uses asynchronous activity to complete its work, 
    then that function must have an asynchronous interface (takes a callback and/or returns a promise)!

### Demo: Copy Dir

* ~~Jest `done`~~
	* test parameter
	* Tests function.length
	* if > 0, test is async
	* calling done with any non-null argument is failure (matches node callback signature)
* and node `fs` module
* Jest `beforeEach` and friends
* Orchestration?
	* Sequential
	* Parallel
		* Async order is "completion" based
