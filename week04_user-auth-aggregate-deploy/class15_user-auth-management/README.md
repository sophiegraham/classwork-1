===

## Questions and Issues
* ?

## Learning Objectives

1. Create and add users by (unique) username and a password using auth routes, mongoose and bcrypt
1. Assign tokens with payloads and authenticate them on requests using JWT
1. Authenticate request on selected routes and allow/reject as appropriate
1. Consolidate business logic in models using static and instance mongoose model methods

## Agenda

Hands on exercise: Fork and Clone `reference-backend`

### Authentication vs Authorization

* Authentication - are you who you say you are?
    1. signup/in username and password match, or
    2. user presents a token given to them when #1 happened
* Authorization - are you allowed to do operation?

### Manage Users

* User Account Model
    * Unique user name (or email)
    * Password handling... `bcrypt-js` - hash password
    * You **must** be careful returning data from this model
        * Consider using `Account` instead if retrieving users is common
    * **EXERCISE**: User Model
* Auth Routes:
    * Signup
    * Signin
    * Verify
    * **EXERCISE**: Signup Auth Routes

### Issue Tokens (JWT - JSON Web Token)

* Keep Users "signed in" - even across new browser
* Stateless
* Keep Info (like "roles" or "user name") in Payload
* **EXERCISE**: Token Service

### Protect Routes

* Create middleware to protect routes
    * Must be "authenticated", ie have a token
    * Check user roles to provide "authorization" checks
* Authorization
*     Check role
* **EXERCISE**: Protect Route
